Project Summary:
Processing data from Crunchyroll on Anime and users ratings. 
We display this information with:
  1. bubble chart: Comparing Rating and number of episodes in the anime
  2. A square pie chart: Comparing the animes rating and the other animes ratings in the selected genre
  3. A graph: Showing the connections of every genre that animes share. The more animes share a specific genre, the bigger the connecting edge/line is. Highlights red on genres in selected anime.
